            <p align="left">Born on July 31, 1980, he is the only son of wizarding couple Jaime Potter and Lily Potter. He is a descendant of Enot Peverley (confirmed in a conversation with Dumbledore at King's Cross Station) and Voldemort, the villainous force in the book, is a descendant of Cadmus Peverley, so they share a common ancestor. Harry has dark hair and green eyes, just like his father, black hair that is always sticking out, and the Potters' talent for flight. His pet was Hedwig the Snowy Owl, a gift from Rupert Hagrid, the Hogwarts Keymaster, for his eleventh birthday. Attempted murdered as an infant by Voldemort, he was the only person in history to survive a death curse and received a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead when his mother's protective spell bounced back at her expense. At the age of seventeen, he was finally freed from the underage magic detection spell. After discovering that he and Voldemort could not co-exist in the world, he followed Dumbledore's guidance and fought against Voldemort, but became the most wanted and unwanted person in the Ministry of Magic, which was controlled by Voldemort. He later returned to Hogwarts in the final battle of Episode VII, gained the support of most of the professors and students, and defeated Voldemort.<br/></p>

            <p align="left">Born on September 19, 1979, into a Muggle family. Appears in the books as a bright girl who likes to study and know everything, sometimes appearing to be a maverick, and whose knowledge proves useful in their many adventures. The only major subject she disliked was astrology, which she considered "inaccurate". It wasn't long after Hermione arrived at Hogwarts that she became the smartest student in the year. Not only did she know the answer to every question, but she also remembered the contents of every book she had read and enjoyed sharing her knowledge with others. This earned her the nickname "Gryffindor Know-It-All" soon after her school career began, and she became famous for her willingness to raise her hand to answer questions in every class and for her willingness to do so.<br/></p>

            <p align="left">Born on March 1, 1980, Harry's best friend at Hogwarts and comedic character in the book. The Weasleys are an ancient pureblood family with flaming red hair. Ron's dad is an employee of the Ministry of Magic's Department for the Prohibition of the Misuse of Muggle Objects, with a low salary and lots of kids, so Ron's family is not rich and most of their stuff is second-hand, which he cares about. He and Harry were buddies and eventually married Hermione.<br/></p>
